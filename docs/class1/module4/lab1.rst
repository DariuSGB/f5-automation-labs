Lab 4.1: Exploring BIG-IQ
-------------------------

This lab will focus on adding **BIG-IP A** and **BIG-IP B** (clustered) in **BIG-IQ CM**.

.. NOTE:: This guide may require you to Copy/Paste information from the
   guide to your jumphost.  To make this easier you can open a copy of the
   guide by using the **Lab Guide** bookmark in Chrome.

.. WARNING:: BIG-IP A and B must be fully configured and provisioned as a cluster (see `previous lab`_)

.. _previous lab: ../module1/lab5.html#task-1-build-a-cluster-using-runner


#. Open Google Chrome and navigate to the following bookmarks: **BIG-IQ CM** or 
   navigate to the URL ``https://10.1.1.4``. Bypass any SSL errors that appear and ensure you see the login screen.

   .. WARNING:: Skipping this step will result in errors in subsequent steps

   .. WARNING:: We are using a self-signed certificate in this lab. In your
      environment you must make sure that you use certificates issued by your
      certificate authority for both production and lab equipments. Not doing
      so would make it possible for an attacker to do a man-in-the-middle
      attack and allow him the ability to steal passwords and tokens.
